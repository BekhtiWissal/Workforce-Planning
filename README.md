Workforce planning is no longer just about filling schedules â€” it's about optimizing human resources, enhancing employee satisfaction, and reducing operational costs. This project delivers AI-powered Smart Schedule Optimizers (SSO) that dynamically create efficient and balanced work schedules tailored to organizational needs through: 
- Predict workload and demand fluctuations.
- Optimize shift allocation based on skills and availability.
- Maximize productivity while ensuring worker well-being.

-Key Features
 - **AI-Driven Decision Making**: Integration of ML models for job allocation and dynamic shift optimization.
 - **Heuristic Algorithms**: Use of Genetic Algorithms, Simulated Annealing & Ant Colony Optimization for complex scheduling scenarios.
 - **Modular Design**: Extensible components for data ingestion, scheduling engine, and performance evaluation.
 - **Customizability**: Adaptable to healthcare, retail, manufacturing, and service industries.
 - **Synthetic Data Generation**: Tools to simulate realistic employee/task datasets when real data is unavailable.
