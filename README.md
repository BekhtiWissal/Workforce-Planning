This repository contains codes and data used in a paper: "Workforce Planning: Developing Smart AI-driven Schedule Optimizers".

In the face of dynamic market conditions and evolving business requirements, workforce planning has become more critical. The conventional manual approaches to scheduling often fall short of addressing the complexities of modern workplaces. Organizations increasingly recognize the need for intelligent, adaptive systems to optimize workforce schedules. This project aims to bridge this gap by leveraging the power of AI to create Smart Schedule Optimizers capable of handling scheduling challenges, ensuring optimal resource utilization, and enhancing overall operational efficiency.

A study conducted by McKinsey $\&$ Company (a global management consulting firm founded in 1926, that offers professional services to corporations, governments, and other organizations) showed the impact of smart scheduling on planning measurements, including job delays and false starts.  
There was also an increase in the productivity of the operators.

In the first part of this paper, we will present a state-of-the-art of 5 different works in the field of digitalizing workforce scheduling. We will then discuss the approach we used and the methodologies we relied on in order to optimize this planning, including heuristic algorithms, machine learning algorithms, and mathematical formulas for calculating fatigue and productivity based on employees and their shifts during the manufacturing working days. We will display our results and compare them to those of the previously presented works as a comprehensive validation process to assess the performance and reliability of the developed SSO. Finally, we explain the different features implemented in the Streamlit application that were developed to make the SSO interactive and user-friendly.

The primary contribution of this work is the development of SSO (Smart Schedule Optimizers) that are equipped with machine learning capabilities to analyze historical data, predict future demand patterns, and dynamically adjust schedules to align with organizational goals. The proposed system aims to enhance workforce efficiency, reduce operational costs, and improve employee satisfaction by generating schedules that balance workload, skill requirements, and individual preferences.
